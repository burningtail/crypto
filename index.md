### Welcome to CRYPTO!

A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technologyâ€”a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.

Virtual currency, decentralized networks, blockchain, you probably got scared and you're about to close this tab, aren't you? It sounds scary, complicated, but once you get into it, it really isn't. Not to mention that who got into crypto years ago, when bitcoin (and I'm mentioning bitcoin here because most of the people heard of it) was really cheap, as cheap as $1300 at the beginning of 2017. I won't dare to mention that it started as low as $0.01 back in 2010. Imagine owning a small amount of bitcoin over the years, considering that its price went over $60.000 now in 2021. How many should one own to be a millionaire? 17 or more, right? If you feel like biting your nails, you're not the only one.

And it's not too late for you either, people started hearing more and more about crypto and most of them are still afraid to enter this unknown world. But the more people will start using crypto, the higher will go the crypto coins' prices.

There are way too many coins and way too many platforms where you can start buying and trading these crypto coins, so I'll only mention the important things to follow when getting into crypto, as well as a few tips in order to avoid getting scammed.

If you're ready to get started, let's get into the first steps.

How to get started?
There are several ways and places to buy and keep your crypto coins, but as a beginner, I highly recommend one of the top 3 safest and easy to use exchanges:

**1. Crypto.com**

`markdown
The app is easy to use, has over 10 million users, and has multiple crypto-backed Visa cards that come in different tires of cashback. Besides buying and trading crypto, on this platform, you can refer an unlimited number of people.

Payout: Immediate.

What you get: Up to $10-$2000 in CRO depending on how much CRO your friend stakes (CRO meaning crypto.com's own coin and 1 CRO is about $0.16 today). In addition, you receive a trading commission of up to 50% of your friend's net trading fees.

What your friends need to do: They must complete advanced KYC, which requires a valid ID and selfie, in addition to basic info like names and date of birth. Your referee must also stake at least 1000 CRO.

What your friends get: $25 worth of CRO

**2. Binance**

`markdown
Binance, one of the biggest exchanges in the world, offers a referral program too, you can use to make money from. First, you have to register on the exchange and generate a link or a scannable QR code.

Go to "Account," then click on "My referral ID." On the referral page, you would see a list of how many friends you've invited. You also see how much you've earned so far. You can invite as many people as you want.

Payout: Every 24 hours, refreshed at 12:00 AM UTC.

What you get: Between 20-40% of your friend's trading fees.

What your friends need to do: Sign up and trade to generate rewards for you.

What your friends get: This depends solely on if you want to share and how much you are willing to. If you have a wallet balance of less than 500 BNB (approximately $278,000), you can choose to share 5 or 10% of your 20% commission from your referral's trades. For accounts with more than 500 BNB, you can choose to share 5%-20% of your 40% commission. You can choose not to share at all too.

**3. Coinbase**

`markdown
Coinbase comes in 3rd, at least in my own opinion, as it has higher fees and low rewards compare to the above 2.

Does Coinbase have an affiliate program? It's not a big deal but it has. On the web version, head over to the "Referrals" page. If you are using the app, tap on "Settings." After that, copy and share. Any crypto trading done by your friends has to occur within six months after they sign up. Coinbase does not require a bulk $100 trade, as trades can be a sum of $100 over 180 days. Although there are no limits on the number of people you can refer, there are limits to the amount you can earn in referral bonuses.

Payout: Every four business days.

What you get: $10 from every trade equivalent to $100.

What your friends need to do: Complete account details, then make a $100 trade on Coinbase.

What your friends get: Same $10 you get.

In order to get the above benefits, don't forget to use this link when you're creating your account. If the link fails, you can simply type this in the referral box: banica_u1

Other exchanges that are safe to use: Krakken, Gemini, and perhaps a few others. However, I would stick to the top ones, as they aren't just the safest, but you also get benefits out of them.

Now all this info about so many exchanges, staking, and so on, might be overwhelming. Take it slow, once you have an account on one or more of these exchanges, don't start throwing money in every cheap coin, hoping that everything will skyrocket overnight. Join instead a few crypto groups on your social media accounts, and keep yourself updated about the coins that people are talking about the most, focus on those that grow over the years, inform yourself about their projects, and decide on your own if you think it's a good idea to invest in them.

There are a few DON'Ts that you should keep in mind, in order to protect yourself:

**DON'T invest more than you can afford to lose!

DON'T trust the "investors" that will claim to help you make a profit (stay away especially from all the telegram groups).

DON'T put your life savings into an exchange. If you're planning to invest a high amount of money, consider using a cold wallet.

DON'T panic sell, many people are quitting crypto because of FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt). HODLing is always a good idea.**

 

I certainly left many things unsaid, but never stop informing yourself if you want to be safe in the crypto world. Happy earnings!
